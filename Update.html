            <p style="font-size: larger; text-align: justify;">Newly minted 34-year-old Taylor Swift has a lot to celebrate. The pop star and Time’s 2023 Person of the Year released 
                Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour (Extended Version) for streaming on December 13—her birthday. The movie is available for 
                rent on major streaming platforms, including Amazon Prime Video and Apple TV+. It includes performances of three 
                songs “Long Live,” “The Archer,” and “Wildest Dreams”—that didn’t make the theatrical cut.
                On Monday, the 12-time Grammy winner notched her first Golden Globe Award nomination for the movie, which smashed the record 
                for highest-grossing concert film of all time. The Eras Tour is competing in the new Cinematic and Box Office Achievement category 
                alongside some of this year’s biggest blockbusters including Greta Gerwig’s Barbie, The Super Mario Bros. Movie, and 
                Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer. The award recognizes excellence among movies that earned at least $150 million, including 
                $100 million domestically. The 2024 Golden Globes are on January 7. <a href="https://www.biography.com/musicians/taylor-swift"><i>Click for more</i></a></h3>

            <p style="font-size: larger; text-align: justify;">
                The pop star’s record-breaking, career-spanning show has dominated the summer, commanding attention and whipping up demand at a level thought unachievable in a fragmented age.
                As Taylor Swift rolled into Los Angeles this week, the frenzy surrounding her record-breaking Eras Tour was already in high gear.
                Headlines gushed that she had given $100,000 bonuses to her crew. Politicians asked her to postpone her concerts in solidarity with striking hotel workers. Scalped tickets 
                were going for $3,000 and up. And there were way, way too many friendship bracelets to count.

                    [Verse 1]
                    Friends break up, friends get married
                    Strangers get born, strangers get buried
                    Trends change, rumors fly through new skies
                    But I'm right where you left me
                    Matches burn after the other
                    Pages turn and stick to each other
                    Wages earned and lessons learned
                    But I, I'm right where you left me
    
                    [Pre-Chorus]
                    Help, I'm still at the restaurant
                    Still sitting in a corner I haunt
                    Cross-legged in the dim light
                    They say, "What a sad sight," I
                    I swear you could hear a hair pin drop
                    Right when I felt the moment stop
                    Glass shattered on the white cloth
                    Everybody moved on, I, I stayed there
                    Dust collected on my pinned-up hair
                    They expected me to find somewhere
                    Some perspective, but I sat and stared right where
    
                    [Chorus]
                    You left me, you left me no, oh, you left me no
                    You left me no choice but to stay here forever
                    You left me, you left me no, oh, you left me no
                    You left me no choice but to stay here forever
                    [Bridge]
                    Did you ever hear about the girl who got frozen?
                    Time went on for everybody else, she won't know it
                    She's still twenty-three inside her fantasy
                    How it was supposed to be
                    Did you hear about the girl who lives in delusion?
                    Breakups happen every day, you don't have to lose it
                    She's still twenty-three inside her fantasy
                    And you're sitting in front of me
                </p>
                <p style="float: right;">
                    [Pre-Chorus]
                    At the restaurant
                    When I was still the one you want
                    Cross-legged in the dim light
                    Everything was just right, I
                    I could feel the mascara run
                    You told me that you met someone
                    Glass shattered on the white cloth
                    Everybody moved on
                    Help, I'm still at the restaurant
                    Still sitting in a corner I haunt
                    Cross-legged in the dim light
                    They say, "What a sad sight," I, I stayed there
                    Dust collected on my pinned-up hair
                    I'm sure that you got a wife out there
                    Kids and Christmas, but I'm unaware 'cause I'm right where
                    I cause no harm, mind my business
                    If our love died young, I can't bear witness, and it's been so long
                    If you ever think you got it wrong, I'm right where
                    [Chorus]
                    You left me, you left me no, oh, you left me no
                    You left me no choice but to stay here forever
                    You left me, you left me no, oh, you left me no
                    You left me no choice but to stay here forever</p>
